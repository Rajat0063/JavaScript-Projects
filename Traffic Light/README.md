# 🚦 Traffic Light <a name="about-project"></a>

This Traffic Light simulation presents a sleek and functional design, set against a calming gradient blue background. Positioned to the center-right, the traffic light features a black vertical casing with three circular lights—red, yellow, and green. Using JavaScript, the lights dynamically transition to replicate the timing and behavior of real-world traffic signals. The currently active red light emits a soft glow, drawing attention, while the other lights remain subtly dimmed.
