# 🕒 Clock Theme <a name="about-project"></a>

This is a sleek and minimalistic digital clock interface that combines analog and digital time displays. The central feature is an analog clock with red and white hands, set against a black background for maximum contrast and readability. Below the clock face, the current time is displayed in a bold, digital format, followed by the date in smaller text. A toggle button at the top allows users to switch between "Light mode" and "Dark mode," catering to different viewing preferences.
